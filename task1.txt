                                                       DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1&HTTP 2


1)HTTP1.1;

=> HTTP1.1[Hyper Text Transfer Porotocol]was invented in 1997(world wide web)

=>FEAUTURES of http1.1

   *Cache control,content negotiation,that allowed for different language,content encodings
and types

   *A client and server can come to an agremeent as to which reperesentation is most suitable
   
   *New http methods were added
   
   *Yet another enrichment came from the ability to support server co-location

   *The protocol was able to support servers hosted on different domains but located at the same IP address

2)HTTP2;

=>Published in 2014-2015

=>Reperesents a major revision of th protocol developed by the http working group of the intrenet engenering task force
(IETF)

=>FEAUTURES of HTTP2

   *The effort to standarice the protocol was supported popular intrenet browser

   *Including google crome,microsoft edge,internet exploror,mozilla firefox,oprea,apple safari and amazon silk

   *And web server software including Apache and Nginx

CONCLUSION;

    =>HTTP/2 differs from its predecessor in several ways but most obviously, it is a binary protocol that cannot be written or read manually. 
    It introduces HTTP header field Compression and supports multiple concurrent data exchanges on a single HTTP Connection. 
    New functionality is available for resetting a message, which allows the client to stop mid-action and start anew, 
    without having to drop and reset the HTTP Connection. Flow control and prioritization allow for multiplexed data streams, 
    and it supports the unsolicited push of HTTP responses from the server to the client
