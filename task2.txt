                                                    OBJECTS AND ITS REPRESENTATION


INTRODUCTION:
           => Object is a a super helper that can carry a bunch of different things for you. It can hold information like names, numbers, or even more objects.
            Think of it as a toolbox for your code. Objects are variables. Objects can contain many values. Object values are written as name : value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).
             Objects are similar to the dictionaries in python,Hash tables in C,Hash maps in Java.

Inside the Object:
                =>When we create an object, we fill it with treasures called properties. Each property has a name (like a      label) and a value (like the treasure inside). 
                These properties are like the traits of your object — they definewhat it is.
 
EX;
   var hero ={
       name "Vijay"
       age "49"
     assets "crores"
    }

Internal Representation:
                 Now, let’s talk about the magic behind the scenes. Every object has some hidden stuff — we call them internal properties.
                 They’re like the engine inside a car, making sure everything runs smoothly.
